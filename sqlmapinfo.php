        <strong>What is nmap?</strong><br>
        <p>sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL
            injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche
            features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database
            fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing
            commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.</p>.
